# Self-made-IOT-Device

## Overview of project
This project is a self-induced project inspired by a Summer IoT course as well as my Internship at Delta Electronics. It is a program based heavily off the same project completed in the Internship, but instead of reading data off an UNO Sense device, I will be using an Arduino with a DHT11 sensor to create my own pseudo-IoT device and display that data on an Android phone.

## Features of project
1. Create Arduino circuit to make pseudo-IoT device
2. Create Arduino script to read off sensor
3. Android application to read data from sensor
4. Android application displays data from sensor

## Technologies used
- Java
- Arduino (based on C/C++)

## Additional notes
It should be noted that this project was done long before learning good proper programming concepts such as organized file structure and useful commenting. This has since improved. The final product however is still worth publishing due to its core abilities.
